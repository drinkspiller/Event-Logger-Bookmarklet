# Event Logger Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet allows you to log various events occurring on any
webpage. It captures mouse, keyboard, touch, and other events, providing
detailed information in the developer console.

## Instructions

1.  Open the [demo](https://drinkspiller.github.io/Event-Logger-Bookmarklet/). Drag the "Log Events" button to your browser's bookmarks bar.
2.  Navigate to any webpage (or use the demo area below) and click the
    bookmarklet in your bar to start logging events for that page in the
    developer console.
3.  Open the developer console (typically, F12 will open the browser's
    developer console) and start interacting with the page.

    **Note:** Some websites might have security policies
    (Content Security Policy - CSP) that prevent bookmarklets from running
    correctly.
